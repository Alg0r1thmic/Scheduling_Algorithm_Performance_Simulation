# A Simulation and a performance comparaison of different server's Packet Scheduling Algorithms .
This is a Python Jupyter Notebook for a discrete event Simulation that simulates different server' scheduling algorithms such as EDF (Earliest Deadline First), FIFO (First In First Out) and RR (Round Robin) . 

It makes a performance and behavior comparison ,for these algorithms ,  while operating in different random scenarios ( Gaussian and exponential distributions ) using charts .
